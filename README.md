# CEBR: Common Elements of Band Representation

A simple Python program to determine p-d orbital coupling at the Γ point in materials.

## Overview
CEBR (Common Elements of Band Representation) is a lightweight Python program designed to identify whether the Band Representations of anion p-orbitals and cation d-orbitals share common elements at the Γ point (Brillouin zone center) in materials. This analysis helps determine if p-d orbital coupling occurs at the Γ point.

## Key Features
- **No installation required**: Ready to use after download
- **Simple workflow**: Minimal setup with straightforward file handling
- **Purpose-built**: Specifically designed for p-d orbital coupling analysis at the Γ point

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x environment
- Output files generated by the POS2ABR program

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Input Files**
   - Obtain output files using the POS2ABR program
   - Rename these output files to `out` (without file extension)

2. **File Placement**
   - Place the renamed `out` file in the same directory as the CEBR program files

3. **Run the Program**
   - Execute the CEBR main script using Python:
